    "summary": "Convex database patterns and rules for MKS Agencies. Covers the schema as source of truth (frontend/convex/schema.ts), all tables (users, orders, orderItems, orderStatusHistory, wishlist, cart) with their indexes, correct query patterns (always use withIndex, never filter), mutation validation with v. validators, file upload workflow (generateUploadUrl → upload → getFileUrl), schema change protocol, and critical gotchas (never .collect() without .take(N), never manually construct storage URLs).",
