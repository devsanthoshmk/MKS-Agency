    "title": "MKS Agencies — Common Pitfalls, Gotchas & Debugging Guide",
    "summary": "Known pitfalls, common mistakes, and debugging patterns discovered during MKS Agencies development. Key gotchas: manually constructing Convex storage URLs returns 404 (use api.files.getFileUrl instead), string paths for Convex mutations don't work (use api.* objects), .collect() without .take(N) causes unbounded queries, Node.js APIs crash Workers, localStorage for auth tokens is risky. Also covers the order status flow (SACRED, never modify), and the testing approach (Vitest + Workers pool).",
